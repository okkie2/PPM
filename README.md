# Self-Evaluation Form for Product Managers

### Overview
This project is designed to assist product managers in assessing their competencies across 12 key areas. Using a Typeform self-evaluation form, product managers can gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses, aiding in their professional development and project alignment.
### Features
* **Self-Evaluation Form**: A comprehensive form created in Typeform covering 12 product management competencies.
* **Automated Data Processing**: Utilizes Google Apps Script to process form submissions and store results in a Google Sheet.
* **Individual Competency Reports**: Generates personalized reports for each participant, highlighting their competency levels.

### How It Works
1. **Form Submission**: Product managers complete the self-evaluation form on Typeform.
2. **Data Handling**: Upon form submission, the script processes the responses, storing them in a Google Sheet.
3. **Report Generation**: For each submission, a tailored report is created, showcasing the individual's competency profile.
